## INTRODUCTION

In this project, I worked as a data analyst to design and build an interactive Power BI dashboard for monitoring the performance of digital marketing campaigns across multiple channels, including email, Instagram ads, and influencer marketing.
The goal was to provide stakeholders with a clear, real-time view of campaign performance and help optimize future marketing strategies.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

- Which marketing channel had the highest ad spend?
- How do clicks compare to impressions across different campaigns?
- What is the conversion rate by product category?
- Which products generated the highest revenue?
- How does ROI vary across products and categories?
- What are the time-based trends for ad spend, conversions, ROI, and clicks?


## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

- DAX calculations to create measures for Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, ROI, total impressions, clicks, revenue, and conversions to enable dynamic and accurate reporting.
- Data Visualization and Dashboard Design in Power BI—Designed interactive visuals such as bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to communicate insights effectively. I also built a clean, professional, and user-friendly dashboard with consistent formatting, color coding, and a clear visual hierarchy.
